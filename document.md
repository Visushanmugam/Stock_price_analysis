We are inviting you to participate in an assignment round, an elimination stage, designed to assess your technical and problem-solving skills. Succeeding in this assignment will lead you to a 1-hour interview with myself and another founder, ultimately determining your offer based on your overall performance.
The Objective of the assignment is to analyse the trend of EUR/INR for the upcoming day and week using technical indicators. Feel free to make assumptions as needed but proceed with the task at hand. Please note that I will be unavailable to respond to any queries during this period.
Assignment:
1. Scrape the EUR/INR currency data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from January 1, 2023, to February 16, 2024.

Note: Please consult various online sources to understand how to perform technical analysis on the currency market.
3. Based on the results of the technical indicators, make a decision to BUY, SELL or remain NEUTRAL? for the specified time frames.
